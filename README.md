# Case

```
Case 6: Media – Metadata Hub
In our fourth Media case, you'll be challenged to bring together all kinds of metadata about content together in one hub.
MEDIAGENIX is in the process of building content intelligence applications, that can help the world’s biggest media companies make smart decisions around which content they should buy for their TV channels and streaming platforms.
```

```
Case 6: In order to make smart decisions about which content TV channels and streaming platforms should buy, it would be very useful to aggregate as much data as possible from open sources. This metadata should be brought together in one hub. This hub should then be able to be effectively used for some purposes..
```

```
case 6 is more on getting an overview of what we have in terms of rights, what ar emy competitors doing, what is being released next year, what is doing well in the netherlands. to get a basis for some intelligence to propose/recommend what I should buy or do
